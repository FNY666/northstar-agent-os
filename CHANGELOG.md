# Northstar Agent OS — initial public component

This repository establishes the Northstar Agent OS name and publishes the first independently maintained component: Northstar Codex Sidecar.

## Fixes since the initial component

- **`CODEX_HOME` is no longer double-nested under systemd.** The unit set `CODEX_HOME=/var/lib/northstar-codex/codex-home` while the sidecar appended a second `/codex-home`, so Codex looked for credentials in a directory the host never populated. `CODEX_HOME` is now passed to the child verbatim, and the workspace default is decoupled from it so run inputs and credentials never share a directory. Tests assert the unit's `Environment=` lines against `service.service_config()`.
- **A maximum-length prompt is no longer rejected by framing.** The socket reader capped input at 200,000 bytes while the validator capped the prompt at 100,000 characters, so a 100,000-character CJK prompt (300,054 bytes raw, 600,182 bytes as `\uXXXX` escapes) came back as `invalid or oversized request`. The wire cap is now derived from the prompt cap and covers both serialisations.
- **`serve()` enforces the socket path contract.** `service.validate_socket_path` was previously asserted only in tests; the listener now refuses to bind any path it rejects, and does so before creating a socket file.
- **`install.sh` produces a startable service.** It now requires root, creates the `northstar-codex` system account and the `/var/lib/northstar-codex` state directories, normalises `PATH` so the sbin account tools are found, warns when `codex` is absent, and is idempotent. Both lifecycle scripts are now mode `0755` so the documented `sudo ./install.sh` works from a fresh clone.

## Scope of this release

- restricted Unix-socket transport;
- bounded request validation;
- read-only, ephemeral Codex execution;
- structured errors and redaction;
- process-group timeout cleanup;
- systemd hardening template;
- deterministic Python tests.

## Explicit non-goals

This is not yet a complete multi-agent operating system, hosted service, or endorsement of the upstream OpenBot project. Runtime identity binding, per-run workspace authorization, native Linux E2E, and production deployment integration remain host-level responsibilities.

See [README.md](README.md) for installation and security boundaries.
